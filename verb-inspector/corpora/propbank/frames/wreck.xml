        <note>Verbnet predicts an instrumental subject.  They also bring thedistinction between agent and instrument down to intentionality, whichwe've been trying to avoid.  If you feel you can consistently makethat decision, go ahead; otherwise only use arg2 when there is also anarg0. (from wreck.01-v)
Use arg 2 only when arg 0 is persent if you cannot tell whether the causer has intentionality. If you can tell there was no agentivity or intentionality, you may use arg 2 even if there is no present arg 0. (from wreck.01-n)</note>
