         Usually of the form THERE + BE (finite)
         Compare to sense 3; the thing &quot;being&quot; here is 
             an event, not an entity.
         Note: does not indicate having an ongoing existence like sense #3 - is more temporary
         Example: 'There is a play this weekend' does not indicate a permanent state, it indicates
                  something that will occur, and then end.
