        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; although both can be quantitative,
              this sense does not include &quot;filling.&quot; This sense also
              applies to a misrepresentation of the object inflated and
              involves an intent to deceive. Also, compare to
              sense 4; this sense does not apply to any instances of price
              or curreny inflation.
