        Note: be careful to distinguish this from sense 7, wherein
        something is being IMPROVED rather than increased. Try paraphrasing
        both verbs if you are unsure, and see which seems to better capture
        the semantics. If "increase" is better, then it's sense 1. If "improve"
        is better, then it's sense 7.
