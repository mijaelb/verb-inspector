        Is: KNOCK COLD, KNOCK OUT
        NOTE: this 'render unconscious' often is a result of being 'knocked down' and may
              be confused with sense 1; sense 1 ONLY has the implication of being hit (you may
              be knocked down without being made unconscious) but the additional inference
              of being knocked unconscious is in this sense
