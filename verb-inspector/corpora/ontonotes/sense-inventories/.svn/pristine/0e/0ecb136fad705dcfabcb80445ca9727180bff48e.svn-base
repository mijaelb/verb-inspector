        Note: differs from sense #2 because in this sense you are not reducing or diminishing
              You are separating or inserting or removing. 
       Syntax Is:
        NP1 CUT NP2[patient[concrete]]
       Includes: CUT AWAY, CUT BACK, CUT DOWN, CUT IN, CUT INTO, CUT OFF,
              CUT UP, CUT TO RIBBONS
       Note that the CUT OFF instances that fit in this sense MUST be
              prepositional. The object MUST come before the word "off." E.g.: "He cut the branch off the tree," NOT
              "They cut off their son" (This is sense 6).

      NOTE: NP2 is the thing formed or made.
      NOTE: The &quot;cutting&quot; is the act of creating/forming NP2; you
        should be able to paraphrase with "create" or "form" instead of

        a new style).
