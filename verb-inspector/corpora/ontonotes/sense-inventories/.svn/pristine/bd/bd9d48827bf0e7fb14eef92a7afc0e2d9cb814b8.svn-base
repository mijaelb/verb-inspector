        Note: the true light verb usage involves an eventive/stative noun
        complement, and is either 1) not semantically compatible with a
        recipient: ?I gave him a groan, OR 2) the indirect object or "to
        phrase" clearly represents a patient (as opposed to a goal or
        recipient) of the true predicate, as seen in "I gave the floor a
        sweep."  If you see an indirect object or object of true phrase
        that is inanimate, it is more likely to be a light verb.
