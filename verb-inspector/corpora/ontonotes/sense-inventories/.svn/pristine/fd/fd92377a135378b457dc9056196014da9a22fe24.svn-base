            Half a loaf of bread will only last me a day.
            Half an hour isn't enough time to finish that test.
            A century and one half went by before that land was used again.
            George missed the first half of the game trying to park the car.
            My date got bored during the second half and left to get drunk.

            At the half there was a great performance.
            I missed the performance because I went for snacks at the half.
