        NOTE: Throughout this task, please beware of adjectival usages, such
              as &quot;added value&quot;(adj+noun)--but note that &quot;added value&quot; may also
              be a verb+object (sense 3).  Please decide carefully, and tag &quot;X&quot; for adjectives.
        NOTE: Compare carefully to sense 3; in this sense, a unit is given to an entity, a 
              portion is given to a total. In sense 3, parts 1 and 2 are combined to create
              the entity (a number or total).
