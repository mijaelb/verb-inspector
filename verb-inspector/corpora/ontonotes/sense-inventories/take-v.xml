       NOTE: Includes only light verb usages.

             related to the LVC: "...take a trip to Bermuda."

       TAKE A DIVE, TAKE A HOP, TAKE A LOOK, TAKE A SHIT, TAKE AIM, TAKE ARMS,

        Note: ONLY choose this sense for the phrases listed below. Please check carefully. Extra modifiers 
            may be added, but be sure the basic sense is the same. For example, "take a big chance"
            would count as an instance of "take a chance." However, "take a leave (from her job)" is not 
            the same as "take leave (of his grandmother)" and should not be tagged with this sense.
